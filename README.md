# Pixel Harvest

**Pixel Harvest** is a 2D pixel art platformer developed in Unity, inspired by the classic arcade games I grew up playing, such as *Super Mario*. The game offers a nostalgic feel with retro visuals while providing a modern gameplay experience filled with challenges.

## Gameplay

The objective is simple: navigate through progressively challenging levels, collect fruits, and avoid traps. Each level will introduce new obstacles and mechanics, testing your timing and spatial awareness as you progress. The game is aimed at casual players of all ages looking for a fun and engaging platformer experience.

## Features

- **Classic Platforming Mechanics**: Move left and right, jump, and interact with collectables.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: New traps and challenges emerge as you advance through the game.
- **Pixel Art Aesthetic**: Nostalgic pixel art with vibrant colors to engage players of all ages.
- **Collectables and Traps**: Collect fruits while avoiding dangerous traps, with a score tracker and timer.
- **Optimized Performance**: The game runs smoothly across various resolutions and screen sizes.
- **Developed in Unity**: Built with C# using free Unity asset packs for characters, tiles, and music.

## Development

Pixel Harvest was developed as part of my Year 2 project for the Software Development 2 module at the University of Hertfordshire. The game was built using **Unity** with **C#**, following Scrum methodology for structured development. Since this project is now complete, there are no plans for future updates as I am currently focusing on more advanced university projects in my final year.

### Development Phases

- **Sprint 1**: Asset selection and platform evaluation.
- **Sprint 2**: Player mechanics for movement and jumping.
- **Sprint 3**: Implementing logic for collectables and traps.
- **Sprint 4**: Level design and iteration.
- **Sprint 5**: UI creation and tutorial level.

## How to Play

- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys to move left and right.
- **Jumping**: Press the up arrow to jump.
- **Objective**: Collect all the fruits in the level and avoid traps to reach the finish line.
